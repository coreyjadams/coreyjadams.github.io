<div>I am Corey Adams, physicist and developer.  Currently I'm a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard University, but I'm based at <a href="http://www.fnal.gov/">Fermi National Accelerator Lab </a> outside of Chicago, IL.</div>

<br>

<div>Day to day, my main focus is on the application of Deep Learning to neutrino experiments, particularly the <a href="http://sbn-nd.fnal.gov/">SBND</a>, <a href="https://microboone-exp.fnal.gov/">MicroBooNE</a>, and <a href="http://next.ific.uv.es/next/">NEXT</a> experiments.  You can see more about them over on the <a href="neutrinos">neutrino</a> page.  For Deep Learning, I'm a leader and active member of the <a href="http://deeplearnphysics.org/">Deep Learn Physics</a> group, where we're building common tools for neutrino experiments to apply deep learning techniques.</div>

<br>

<div> I'm also passionate about <a href="data-visualization">Data Visualization</a> - I've written the official visualization software for three different neutrino experiments (with the 4th in review!) and some very fun tools for visualization of deep learning training data and output for the DeepLearnPhysics group.</div>
