<p>Neutrinos are the smallest particles ever discovered, and a key player in the Standard Model of particle physics.  Most of my physics research revolves around learning the fundamental properties of neutrinos - something we know surprisingly little about so far. </p>

<p>I work on two distinct but related neutrino projects.  With <a href="/http://sbn-nd.fnal.gov/">SBND</a> and <a href="https://microboone-exp.fnal.gov/">MicroBooNE</a>, I'm part of a collaboration studying high energy neutrinos for hints of anamolous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino_oscillation">oscillations</a> - indications of a possible fourth type of neutrino.</p>  Both MicroBooNE and SBND are liquid argon time projection chambers, which is a large scale, high resolution imaging detector.

<p>I also work on the <a href="http://next.ific.uv.es/next/">NEXT</a> experiment, a high pressure gaseous xenon time projection chamber.  NEXT is a low background, precision experiment searching for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_beta_decay">neutrinoless double beta decay.</a></p>

<p> Neutrino experiments typically all share the same general features.  First, neutrinos only interact via the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_interaction">weak force</a>, meaning that their interaction rates are very low compared to other particle interactions via the strong and electromagetic forces.  Second (and also because neutrinos only interact via the weak force), the only way to observe neutrino interactions is to detect the remnants of their interactions.</p>

<p> Because of the rare interaction rates, neutrino experiments all use clever techniques to increase the number of detected neutrinos compared to background events.  Some experiments, particularly <a href="https://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/november-2012/how-to-make-a-neutrino-beam">beam-based</a> neutrino experiments, use an incredibly high influx of neutrinos to compensate for the very low interaction rate.  Experiments like those in the <a href="https://sbn.fnal.gov/">SBN</a> Program take advantage of this.</p>

<p> Another technique for improving neutrino experiments is to use high precision neutrino detectors, either with excellent energy resolution, high resolution imaging, or both.  A time projection chamber is a technology for neutrino experiments that can use all the tricks in the book for making a great neutrino experiment: it's scalable to very large sizes, can have state of the art energy resolution, and has imaging precision that is only rivaled by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_chamber">bubble chambers.</a></p>

<p>MicroBooNE, SBND, and NEXT are all variations of a time projection chamber, which is an exciting technology in high energy physics.</p>
