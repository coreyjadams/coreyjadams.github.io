<p>Neutrinos are the smallest particles ever discovered, and a key player in the Standard Model of particle physics.  Most of my physics research revolves around learning the fundamental properties of neutrinos - something we know surprisingly little about so far. </p>

<p>I work on two distinct but related neutrino projects.  With <a href="/http://sbn-nd.fnal.gov/">SBND</a> and <a href="https://microboone-exp.fnal.gov/">MicroBooNE</a>, I'm part of a collaboration studying high energy neutrinos for hints of anamolous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino_oscillation">oscillations</a>.
