<div style='font-weight: bold'>Image Classification, Object Detection, Pixel Segmentation, Generative Networks </div>

My primary research interest in neutrino physics is the application of deep convolutional neural networks to very difficult pattern recognition problems.  In particular, cosmogenic background removal via pixel segmentation, neutrino interaction localization, and event topology classification are active research areas.
